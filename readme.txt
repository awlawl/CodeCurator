Code Curator is a set of tools to allow you to quickly index and search your source code and related files.

It was built with these goals in mind:

* Use Solr's existing functionality whenever possible. 
* Create a web based search that is pure HTML and javascript that talks to Solr directly. No server side web scripting.
* Do not use an additional database to store settings or configuration metadata. Use Solr itself or simple configuration documents.

This project is a work in progress.
